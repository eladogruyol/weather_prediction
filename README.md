# Weather Prediction project for Machine Learning class

This project is done as an assignment for Machine Learning (YAP470) class. In this project, a weather prediction is tried to be done according to input variables. Data is found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ananthr1/weather-prediction) and various Supervised Learning techniques are used and compared at the end.

First, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is done with data. This technique is used to observe and understand the details of dataset.

Second, some preprocessing steps are done to organize the dataset accordingly.

Then, dataset is splitted into train and test parts. After the split, different classifiers (Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, K- Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression) are selected and trained. Results of training is tested and observed.

After the first experiment, data is oversampled to get it balanced. All experiments are done again on this new balanced dataset.

Finally, all results are summarized and compared.
